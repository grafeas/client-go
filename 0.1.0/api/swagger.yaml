    description: "paths: \"f.a\"\n    paths: \"f.b.d\"\n\nHere `f` represents a field\
      \ in some root message, `a` and `b`\nfields in the message found in `f`, and\
      \ `d` a field found in the\nmessage in `f.b`.\n\nField masks are used to specify\
      \ a subset of fields that should be\nreturned by a get operation or modified\
      \ by an update operation.\nField masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see\
      \ below).\n\n# Field Masks in Projections\n\nWhen used in the context of a projection,\
      \ a response message or\nsub-message is filtered by the API to only contain\
      \ those fields as\nspecified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous\n\
      example is applied to a response message as follows:\n\n    f {\n      a : 22\n\
      \      b {\n        d : 1\n        x : 2\n      }\n      y : 13\n    }\n   \
      \ z: 8\n\nThe result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z\n\
      (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text\noutput):\n\
      \n\n    f {\n      a : 22\n      b {\n        d : 1\n      }\n    }\n\nA repeated\
      \ field is not allowed except at the last position of a\npaths string.\n\nIf\
      \ a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the\noperation applies\
      \ to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields\nhad been specified).\n\nNote\
      \ that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the\ntop-level response message.\
      \ In case of a REST get operation, the\nfield mask applies directly to the response,\
      \ but in case of a REST\nlist operation, the mask instead applies to each individual\
      \ message\nin the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,\n\
      other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be\nclearly documented\
      \ together with its declaration in the API.  In\nany case, the effect on the\
      \ returned resource/resources is required\nbehavior for APIs.\n\n# Field Masks\
      \ in Update Operations\n\nA field mask in update operations specifies which\
      \ fields of the\ntargeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required\n\
      to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask\nand leave\
      \ the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to\ndescribe the updated\
      \ values, the API ignores the values of all\nfields not covered by the mask.\n\
      \nIf a repeated field is specified for an update operation, the existing\nrepeated\
      \ values in the target resource will be overwritten by the new values.\nNote\
      \ that a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths`\n\
      string.\n\nIf a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask\
      \ for an\nupdate operation, then the existing sub-message in the target resource\
      \ is\noverwritten. Given the target message:\n\n    f {\n      b {\n       \
      \ d : 1\n        x : 2\n      }\n      c : 1\n    }\n\nAnd an update message:\n\
      \n    f {\n      b {\n        d : 10\n      }\n    }\n\nthen if the field mask\
      \ is:\n\n paths: \"f.b\"\n\nthen the result will be:\n\n    f {\n      b {\n\
      \        d : 10\n      }\n      c : 1\n    }\n\nHowever, if the update mask\
      \ was:\n\n paths: \"f.b.d\"\n\nthen the result would be:\n\n    f {\n      b\
      \ {\n        d : 10\n        x : 2\n      }\n      c : 1\n    }\n\nIn order\
      \ to reset a field's value to the default, the field must\nbe in the mask and\
      \ set to the default value in the provided resource.\nHence, in order to reset\
      \ all fields of a resource, provide a default\ninstance of the resource and\
      \ set all fields in the mask, or do\nnot provide a mask as described below.\n\
      \nIf a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to\nall fields\
      \ (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).\nNote that in the presence\
      \ of schema evolution, this may mean that\nfields the client does not know and\
      \ has therefore not filled into\nthe request will be reset to their default.\
      \ If this is unwanted\nbehavior, a specific service may require a client to\
      \ always specify\na field mask, producing an error if not.\n\nAs with get operations,\
      \ the location of the resource which\ndescribes the updated values in the request\
      \ message depends on the\noperation kind. In any case, the effect of the field\
      \ mask is\nrequired to be honored by the API.\n\n## Considerations for HTTP\
      \ REST\n\nThe HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must\n\
      be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics\n(PUT must\
      \ only be used for full updates).\n\n# JSON Encoding of Field Masks\n\nIn JSON,\
      \ a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are\nseparated by a\
      \ comma. Fields name in each path are converted\nto/from lower-camel naming\
      \ conventions.\n\nAs an example, consider the following message declarations:\n\
      \n    message Profile {\n      User user = 1;\n      Photo photo = 2;\n    }\n\
      \    message User {\n      string display_name = 1;\n      string address =\
      \ 2;\n    }\n\nIn proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:\n\n   \
      \ mask {\n      paths: \"user.display_name\"\n      paths: \"photo\"\n    }\n\
      \nIn JSON, the same mask is represented as below:\n\n    {\n      mask: \"user.displayName,photo\"\
      \n    }\n\n# Field Masks and Oneof Fields\n\nField masks treat fields in oneofs\
      \ just as regular fields. Consider the\nfollowing message:\n\n    message SampleMessage\
      \ {\n      oneof test_oneof {\n        string name = 4;\n        SubMessage\
      \ sub_message = 9;\n      }\n    }\n\nThe field mask can be:\n\n    mask {\n\
      \      paths: \"name\"\n    }\n\nOr:\n\n    mask {\n      paths: \"sub_message\"\
      \n    }\n\nNote that oneof type names (\"test_oneof\" in this case) cannot be\
      \ used in\npaths."

    description: "- Simple to use and understand for most users\n- Flexible enough\
      \ to meet unexpected needs\n\n# Overview\n\nThe `Status` message contains three\
      \ pieces of data: error code, error message,\nand error details. The error code\
      \ should be an enum value of\n[google.rpc.Code][google.rpc.Code], but it may\
      \ accept additional error codes if needed.  The\nerror message should be a developer-facing\
      \ English message that helps\ndevelopers *understand* and *resolve* the error.\
      \ If a localized user-facing\nerror message is needed, put the localized message\
      \ in the error details or\nlocalize it in the client. The optional error details\
      \ may contain arbitrary\ninformation about the error. There is a predefined\
      \ set of error detail types\nin the package `google.rpc` that can be used for\
      \ common error conditions.\n\n# Language mapping\n\nThe `Status` message is\
      \ the logical representation of the error model, but it\nis not necessarily\
      \ the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is\nexposed in different\
      \ client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be\nmapped differently.\
      \ For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions\nin Java, but more\
      \ likely mapped to some error codes in C.\n\n# Other uses\n\nThe error model\
      \ and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of\nenvironments, either\
      \ with or without APIs, to provide a\nconsistent developer experience across\
      \ different environments.\n\nExample uses of this error model include:\n\n-\
      \ Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,\n\
      \    it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial\n\
      \    errors.\n\n- Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each\
      \ step may\n    have a `Status` message for error reporting.\n\n- Batch operations.\
      \ If a client uses batch request and batch response, the\n    `Status` message\
      \ should be used directly inside batch response, one for\n    each error sub-response.\n\
      \n- Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation\n\
      \    results in its response, the status of those operations should be\n   \
      \ represented directly using the `Status` message.\n\n- Logging. If some API\
      \ errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could\n    be used directly\
      \ after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons."
